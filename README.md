# HeadlessBootHelp
Headless Boot Helper for the Raspberry Pi - allows the user to get connected to a Wifi without a monitor - uses a 128x64 pixel OLED and the terminal. 

There are some libraries you have to get.  Adafruit_SSD1306 is the main one.  It should look like this.

You also need to copy Verdana.ttf from http://www.fontpalace.com/font-download/Verdana/ 

Further install instructions will have to be added later - sorry - I know it is important, just no time...
